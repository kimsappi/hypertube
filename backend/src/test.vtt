[Matt] I remember when I was
in second grade

205
00:09:52.287 --> 00:09:56.073

alongside my cousin David.

And he pulled his pants
all the way down to go pee.

[Matt] It seems
like it would feel really good

It would be a photo
of a cat or something

and it would say,
"Feels good, man."

Or there was one version of it

Richard Dawkins' 1976 book,
The Selfish Gene.

Most of the book is about

what he called
"Universal Darwinism,"

which said all of biology
is driven by genes,

in the primeval soup of culture

All of these things
are only here

in message boards.

320
00:15:09.821 --> 00:15:10.910
"Feels good, man."

321
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:13.956
In that little story,

322
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.612
he's owning the fact
that he's this weird guy.

323
00:15:17.655 --> 00:15:19.440
That moment of owning
your loserdom,

324
00:15:19.483 --> 00:15:21.703
like owning your weirdness,
right? It's like...

325
00:15:21.746 --> 00:15:23.357
perfect 4chan ethics.

[Dale] Christopher Poole.

328
00:15:29.058 --> 00:15:32.105
He was 14 years old,
living with his mom,

329
00:15:32.148 --> 00:15:36.239
spending all his time indoors,
on the Internet, and...

330
00:15:36.283 --> 00:15:39.895
He created this crazy monster
in his basement.

331
00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:41.853
[Christopher] Now, over
7 million people are using it,

332
00:15:41.897 --> 00:15:44.552
contributing over 700,000 posts per day.

333
00:15:44.595 --> 00:15:48.034
And we've gone
from 1 board to 48 boards.

[suspenseful music]

335
00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:54.866
So 4chan,
just the way that it functioned,

336
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:58.870
was super conducive
to creating memes.

337
00:15:58.914 --> 00:16:00.437
[Dale] The way 4chan works
is that

338
00:16:00.481 --> 00:16:02.613
it's a Darwinian competition
for attention.

339
00:16:02.657 --> 00:16:04.267
So you have a post.

340
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:06.704
And if the post gets
a lot of replies,

341
00:16:06.748 --> 00:16:08.271
it floats to the top.

342
00:16:08.315 --> 00:16:10.012
And if no one replies,
it sinks to the bottom

343
00:16:10.056 --> 00:16:12.188
and quickly dies.

344
00:16:12.232 --> 00:16:14.277
It's a winning
and losing system.

345
00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:15.539
And it's a lot like
a video game.

346
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.673
[Dale] There were all these
adolescent boys

347
00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:20.849
trying to own each other
in the competition.

348
00:16:22.155 --> 00:16:23.808
-And so it became this...
-[whooping]

349
00:16:23.852 --> 00:16:26.594
[Dale] ...culture of saying
the most offensive thing.

350
00:16:28.726 --> 00:16:33.340
And so, like, Pepe kind of melts into that community.

351
00:16:33.383 --> 00:16:34.906
And all of the stuff
that just exploded

352
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.647

four or five years later

by all these clever people

354
00:16:39.128 --> 00:16:41.391

357
00:16:53.099 --> 00:16:57.190
[Pizza]On 4chan, you're talking to another text box

358
00:16:57.233 --> 00:16:59.931
so you're free to express
those kind of secret ideas

359
00:16:59.975 --> 00:17:01.585
that people have

360
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:03.065
that they don't feel comfortable expressing in real life.

361
00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:10.072
I posted Pepes all the time.

362
00:17:10.116 --> 00:17:12.770
To not post Pepe
would be strange

363
00:17:12.814 --> 00:17:15.425
because it's just...
It's the meme.

Post, send. Boom.

365
00:17:18.559 --> 00:17:20.256
[Pizza] So there I am
right there.

366
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.173
It's hard to say why Pepe
gained popularity so fast.

367
00:17:24.217 --> 00:17:28.264
You could say it was just
an easily relatable image.

368
00:17:28.308 --> 00:17:31.354
I have my own collection. I have my reaction image folder

369
00:17:31.398 --> 00:17:33.748
filled with Pepe
and all the derivatives.

370
00:17:36.446 --> 00:17:39.188
The term was like,
"We feel alone together."

371
00:17:39.232 --> 00:17:40.668
[Dale]Um, that was their idea.

372
00:17:43.758 --> 00:17:47.066
As it ages,
it just gets more desperate.

373
00:17:47.109 --> 00:17:50.112
They would describe themselves
as NEET.

374
00:17:50.156 --> 00:17:54.116
NEET stands for Not in Education Employment or Training.

375
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.163
The idea was that
they were trying to find a word

376
00:17:57.206 --> 00:17:59.208
that described their situation,

377
00:17:59.252 --> 00:18:02.037
for these sort of, like,
masses of kids

378
00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:04.953
who are just unemployed or just
kind of dropped out of life.

379
00:18:04.996 --> 00:18:07.347
I think the best thing would be
to start with a job.

380
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.131
-No. No!
-[Dr. Phil] Yeah, absolutely.

[Dale] So 4chan really comes
to embody that culture

384
00:18:17.444 --> 00:18:19.968
of checking out and living
in your mom's basement.

385

It started in 2003
and still exists.

386
00:18:29.717 --> 00:18:32.198
So imagine people
being on there ten years,

387
00:18:32.241 --> 00:18:33.938
like it becoming a lifestyle.

because I just don't give a fuck
about anything.

396
00:19:07.798 --> 00:19:08.799

[Mills] I think I probably saw
images of Pepe first

400
00:19:16.851 --> 00:19:19.723
on the fitness board of 4chan.

You know,
this frog was so prevalent.

He's a frog.

[Mills] Now on 4chan,
the quote-unquote sad frog

408
00:19:44.357 --> 00:19:49.100
became the most popular image
for displaying sadness.

00:19:49.144 --> 00:19:52.713
There were other images that
would describe that feeling.

and it's like a group therapy
on the Internet.

476
00:22:52.458 --> 00:22:54.764
Even when I was at work,
we had these security cameras.

477
00:22:54.808 --> 00:22:56.853
I would duck behind,
like, a stack of crates

478
00:22:56.897 --> 00:22:59.465
and quick to be, like,
"You dumb idiots."

479
00:22:59.508 --> 00:23:01.249
[Mills] Then I'd check,
like, 10-15 minutes later,

480
00:23:01.292 --> 00:23:02.990
you know, to see
who's replying to me,

481
00:23:03.033 --> 00:23:06.123
and I would face an onslaught
of people just saying

482
00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:08.256
I was the most
hideous man alive.

483
00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:10.084
I would, you know, wear that as a badge of honor.

484
00:23:10.127 --> 00:23:12.826
I'd be like,
"Yes. I'm a true 4chan guy.

485
00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:15.959
I'm a true social reject.
I'm a true freak.

486
00:23:16.003 --> 00:23:17.787
Yeah, you're darn tooting."

487
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.534
I'm a latecomer to Pepe.

488
00:23:25.578 --> 00:23:27.580
Uh, probably because
he's not my type.

489
00:23:27.623 --> 00:23:29.364
[laughs]

490
00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:33.412
[Dr. Aleks] I came to Pepe
after he had gone dark.

491
00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:37.285
Pepe is a sad frog.

492
00:23:37.328 --> 00:23:40.027
He's never happy.
He's just sort of miserable.

493
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.985
[thunder crashing]

494
00:23:45.772 --> 00:23:48.862
And I think,
for a huge population,

495
00:23:48.905 --> 00:23:51.342
online and offline,
we're not really allowed

496
00:23:51.386 --> 00:23:54.258
to express sorrow
or sadness or grief.

497
00:23:54.302 --> 00:23:57.784
And this sad little frog
arrives online

498
00:23:57.827 --> 00:24:02.049
in the midst of the push
to commodify the Internet.

499
00:24:03.703 --> 00:24:05.269
[Dr. Aleks] What was going on
at that point

500
00:24:05.313 --> 00:24:07.837
was that everybody
was super damn positive.

501
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:10.971
The people were suddenly able
to make cash money

502
00:24:11.014 --> 00:24:12.886
out of their image

503
00:24:12.929 --> 00:24:15.584
which meant that they had to be, like, totally rad,

504
00:24:15.628 --> 00:24:19.327
happy, fitspo,
my best-self thing.

505
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:23.287
And in drops Pepe...
ripe for the taking.

506
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:24.854
Hey, guys. It's me, Lily.

507
00:24:24.898 --> 00:24:27.335
[upbeat music]

508
00:24:27.378 --> 00:24:30.817
Today I'm going to be doing
a Pepe transformation.

509
00:24:35.517 --> 00:24:38.825
Pepe starts to percolate
into another population.

510
00:24:38.868 --> 00:24:41.958
We've got a lot more women,
a lot more girls.

511
00:24:42.002 --> 00:24:43.699
[Dr. Aleks] They were sharing
their own Pepe.

512
00:24:45.222 --> 00:24:47.877
Hey, guys. I just googled
what a meme was

513
00:24:47.921 --> 00:24:51.359
and I think I'm in love
with memes!

514
00:24:51.402 --> 00:24:54.101
Pepe... is the best.

515
00:24:54.797 --> 00:24:56.364
You draw the head,

516
00:24:57.539 --> 00:25:01.151
which is just like a butt.

517
00:25:01.195 --> 00:25:04.720
[Mills] Things begin to spiral
really out of control.

518
00:25:04.764 --> 00:25:09.464
A couple of celebrities,
Nicki Minaj and Katy Perry,

519
00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:12.815
they had posted on Instagram
a couple of Pepe images.

520
00:25:14.687 --> 00:25:16.471
[airplane whooshing]

521
00:25:19.387 --> 00:25:20.606
[Mills]A lot of people see it for the first time.

522
00:25:20.649 --> 00:25:21.911
They wonder, "Who is this frog?

523
00:25:21.955 --> 00:25:23.434
What is this frog?
What is this?"

524
00:25:23.478 --> 00:25:25.306
I want to see
some more of that.

525
00:25:25.349 --> 00:25:29.528
They start making, like,
a migration over to 4chan.

526
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:31.399
[Mills] Young women
in particular,

527
00:25:31.442 --> 00:25:35.185
downloading Pepe images , using them for their own likes.

528
00:25:35.229 --> 00:25:37.100
And that was seen as...

529
00:25:37.144 --> 00:25:38.188
despicable.

530
00:25:38.232 --> 00:25:40.277
I love Pepe so much.

531
00:25:40.321 --> 00:25:42.541
The true Pepe is this Pepe.

532
00:25:42.584 --> 00:25:45.021
[girl #1]Pepe has green skin. It's so beautiful.

533
00:25:45.065 --> 00:25:46.936
It's different from frog.

534
00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.199
Pepe green is special green.

535
00:25:49.243 --> 00:25:51.288
[eerie music]

536
00:25:51.332 --> 00:25:53.464
[Mills] It seemed to me,
like, invasion.

537
00:25:53.508 --> 00:25:55.336
You had people
that would come on and say,

538
00:25:55.379 --> 00:25:57.425
"Why are all you
virgin losers here?"

539
00:25:57.468 --> 00:25:58.818
You know,
"Where's the Pepe pictures at?

540
00:25:58.861 --> 00:25:59.906
Where are they at?"

541
00:25:59.949 --> 00:26:01.690
[girl #2] I strive to be Pepe.

542
00:26:03.387 --> 00:26:05.868
Just kidding.

543
00:26:05.912 --> 00:26:08.697
I hate Pepe the Frog.

544
00:26:08.741 --> 00:26:10.481
Pe... whatever his name is.

545
00:26:10.525 --> 00:26:11.831
Peep, Pepe.

546
00:26:11.874 --> 00:26:14.834
Either way, he's stupid.

547
00:26:14.877 --> 00:26:18.446
And I don't really know
why I made my face green

548
00:26:18.489 --> 00:26:20.622
to prove the point
that I hate Pepe.

549
00:26:20.666 --> 00:26:22.972
But let me prove it by saying,

550
00:26:23.016 --> 00:26:24.583
"I hate you, Pepe."

551
00:26:24.626 --> 00:26:26.759
I'm going to chop your head off.

552
00:26:26.802 --> 00:26:27.934
Your little...

553
00:26:27.977 --> 00:26:31.720
Your little froggie head off
like this.

554
00:26:31.764 --> 00:26:33.853
It was serious
to a lot of people, like,

555
00:26:33.896 --> 00:26:36.203
"This is the symbol
of our culture."

556
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.382
[Mills] And it really was turning into a total Pepe Fest.

557
00:26:53.176 --> 00:26:56.310
[Matt] Ooh, nice.

558
00:26:56.353 --> 00:26:59.792
[Matt] Pepe was just really turning into a thing and, um...

559
00:26:59.835 --> 00:27:01.489
my buddy Skinner was, like,

560
00:27:01.532 --> 00:27:03.883
"Hey you should do
a clothing line."

561

[fanfare music]

562

[camera shutter clicking]

563
00:27:12.543 --> 00:27:15.634
Yeah, it was just kinda funny
to make something official

564
00:27:15.677 --> 00:27:18.549
out of something that's so,
kind of, like...

565
00:27:18.593 --> 00:27:20.073
bootlegged on the Internet.

566
00:27:22.858 --> 00:27:24.425
I drew all these...

567
00:27:24.468 --> 00:27:27.428
goofy-ass Pepes
that were kinda based on...

568
00:27:27.471 --> 00:27:30.823
just whatever random nonsense
was out there on the Internet.

569
00:27:30.866 --> 00:27:33.303
I like this one
with the little cigarette.

570
00:27:33.347 --> 00:27:35.784
[Matt] This one's
particularly weird.

571
00:27:35.828 --> 00:27:38.395
And this one is just...
[blows raspberry]

572
00:27:38.439 --> 00:27:41.355
I like that. That's a
very stripped down Pepe.

573
00:27:41.398 --> 00:27:44.358
The sad frog golf shirt.

574
00:27:44.401 --> 00:27:46.665
You can have
a pasta meal with your family

575
00:27:46.708 --> 00:27:47.709
wearing this one.

576
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.106
Pepe was, like, a famous meme.

577
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:56.022
[Chris] And my friend, Jay,
he got a tattoo gun.

578
00:27:56.065 --> 00:27:58.328
He just had it set up
in his kitchen.

579
00:27:58.372 --> 00:28:00.200
And so one night,

580
00:28:00.243 --> 00:28:02.028
I think it was just
completely spontaneous.

581
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:05.422
We're just like,
"Oh, let's get Pepe tattoos."

582
00:28:05.466 --> 00:28:08.643
It's like very little thought
goes into this at all, you know.

583
00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:09.688
[chuckles]

584
00:28:11.124 --> 00:28:12.299
[Chris] We just thought
it was funny

585
00:28:12.342 --> 00:28:13.779
to have a Pepe tattoo

586
00:28:13.822 --> 00:28:15.781
and Matt was there
so it was like a tribute

587
00:28:15.824 --> 00:28:17.260
to my friend.

588
00:28:17.304 --> 00:28:18.522
I didn't know at the time

589
00:28:18.566 --> 00:28:21.482
but I got it, like,
below my sleeve here.

590
00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:24.572
[Chris] That would kind of, uh,
come back to bite me.

591
00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:28.750
As the Pepe defense was building

592
00:28:28.794 --> 00:28:31.448
to try and steer people away
from using Pepe

593
00:28:31.492 --> 00:28:34.756
for their own, you know,
normie usage...

594
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:39.587
that spawned a lot of angry,
raging Pepes.

595
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.763
But then,
that fateful day occurred

596
00:28:41.807 --> 00:28:46.246
where there was a YouTube video
of screaming frogs.

for the camera.

Look at the thing blow up
like a balloon.

[scream continues]

a high pitched scream

602
00:29:02.653 --> 00:29:03.916

-[imitates frog scream]
-[squeaky scream]

604
00:29:10.923 --> 00:29:12.925
[Mills] And it became
like this battle cry.

605
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.408
[screaming]

606
00:29:18.452 --> 00:29:19.888
[Mills]There would be somebody who would be coming in

607
00:29:19.932 --> 00:29:22.064
from Instagram.

608
00:29:22.108 --> 00:29:24.850
Sort of out themselves,
maybe a sex-haver

609
00:29:24.893 --> 00:29:26.503
or a woman.

610
00:29:26.547 --> 00:29:30.072
A neurotypical,
socially well-adjusted person.

611

planted in the head of, like,

and look...

look how they're living,

614
00:29:37.166 --> 00:29:38.777
then look at you, you know.
You're this...

615
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.735
You're this... slug.

616
00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:42.215

have been bullying us

our whole lives.

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:45.827
I'll never be one of you
disgusting normies.

[eerie music]

623
00:30:01.712 --> 00:30:04.063
You know, these were a group
of disempowered men

624
00:30:04.106 --> 00:30:06.195
who had retreated
into fantasy worlds.

625
00:30:06.239 --> 00:30:07.849
[growling]

626
00:30:07.893 --> 00:30:10.678
[Dale]That was their last place of retreat, in a sense.

627
00:30:10.721 --> 00:30:14.725
And so, having women there
was what they didn't want

628
00:30:14.769 --> 00:30:17.467
because that was a symbol
of their defeat in real life.

630

633
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.226
She's like,
"Ursula, I'm going to help you."

634
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.620
[Ursula] Aw!

635
00:30:39.663 --> 00:30:41.404
-Okay.
-That's so cute.

636
00:30:41.448 --> 00:30:44.233
That one says,
"A pocket mouse sleeps...

637
00:30:44.277 --> 00:30:46.279
-safely it in its nest."
-That's so cute.

638
00:30:46.322 --> 00:30:47.976
-It's a little mouse.
-Oh.

639
00:30:50.761 --> 00:30:52.502
[Matt]
People would just email me

640
00:30:52.546 --> 00:30:55.027
fucked up pictures of Pepe

641
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:57.464
and it didn't really shock me.

642
00:30:57.507 --> 00:31:00.728
I'd be more shocked by,
you know, people actually...

643
00:31:00.771 --> 00:31:03.905
expressing some form
of cuteness or love

644
00:31:03.949 --> 00:31:07.039
like this other stuff is just...
It's just garbage.

645
00:31:08.823 --> 00:31:10.303
[Matt] I think the weird thing

646
00:31:10.346 --> 00:31:12.131
about American culture
in general is, like,

647
00:31:12.174 --> 00:31:14.220
we do kinda celebrate garbage

648
00:31:14.263 --> 00:31:17.092
and we also produce a hell
of a lot of physical garbage.

649
00:31:17.136 --> 00:31:18.267
So it's just like...

650
00:31:19.529 --> 00:31:20.879
fucking garbage world.

651
00:31:32.194 --> 00:31:33.500
[Matt]
I was definitely conscious

652
00:31:33.543 --> 00:31:35.154
of not wanting to be remembered

653
00:31:35.197 --> 00:31:37.721
as the artist that did
Boy's Club.

654
00:31:37.765 --> 00:31:41.160
So I just wanted
to keep doing other stuff.

655
00:31:41.203 --> 00:31:43.640
There's no connection
between this frog and Pepe

656
00:31:43.684 --> 00:31:46.295
other than they kinda look
like one another.

657
00:31:46.339 --> 00:31:50.473
But this is just another frog
in a different place.

658
00:31:52.606 --> 00:31:54.347
[Matt] I decided to do
a whole kids book

659
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.132
that was totally wordless.

660
00:31:57.176 --> 00:32:01.049
It follows the life of this frog
and his pet rat...

661

a little mushroom house.

00:32:07.577 --> 00:32:10.0659

The problem, I think,664
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:12.626
Okay, look at me.

[Matt] Through the forest

666
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:17.022
then they end up
surfing on some dolphins,

667
00:32:17.065 --> 00:32:18.806
and swimming
and going underground.

668
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.200
I just really went

669
00:32:21.243 --> 00:32:23.680
for the childlike wonder
with this one.

[Brian] The Night Riders.

672
00:32:35.518 --> 00:32:37.477
It's a work of highly skilled craftsmanship.

673
00:32:39.087 --> 00:32:40.654
It took him almost a year
to make it.

674
00:32:42.438 --> 00:32:44.875
I told him, you know,
I saw that he had that in him.

675
00:32:44.919 --> 00:32:46.399
He had a
Where the Wild Things Are

676
00:32:46.442 --> 00:32:48.575
in him, I just knew it.

677
00:32:48.618 --> 00:32:50.055
We were working on
The Night Riders

678
00:32:50.098 --> 00:32:53.797
before all this insane
Pepe stuff started to happen.

679
00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:55.669
[Brian] Pepe's really just
the tip of the iceberg

680
00:32:55.712 --> 00:33:00.152
for the kind of art
that Matt's capable of making.

681
00:33:00.195 --> 00:33:02.458
[Brian] How come the dragon
doesn't have wings?

682
00:33:02.502 --> 00:33:03.982
[Matt] It's more of
a land dragon,

683
00:33:04.025 --> 00:33:06.071
than a dragon of the air
or a dragon of the sea.

684
00:33:06.114 --> 00:33:08.290
So he's... He's a land dragon.

685
00:33:10.162 --> 00:33:12.077
[Brian] The characters
are of different species,

686
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.036
but they seem like friends
from the neighborhood.

687
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.777
We can tell they love each other

688
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.562
and the book is built toward

[crickets chirping]

[Dale] Pepe had escaped
and he was roaming around.

694
00:33:40.105 --> 00:33:41.671
And, like,
it was fun for a while.

00:33:48.548 --> 00:33:49.592
And on 4chan...

700
00:33:50.506 --> 00:33:51.942
whenever they thought

701
00:33:51.986 --> 00:33:54.380
quote-unquote normies,
sort of outsiders or other sites

702
00:33:54.423 --> 00:33:55.903
were stealing their memes,

703
00:33:55.946 --> 00:33:58.906
they would try to make them
as offensive as possible.

704
00:33:58.949 --> 00:34:01.300
[Dale] It's like a classic
punk response.

705
00:34:01.343 --> 00:34:03.302
Literally armored
like a punk, right?

706
00:34:03.345 --> 00:34:04.564
And they're like,
"It's so offensive, I...

707
00:34:04.607 --> 00:34:05.913
It can't be co-opted."

708
00:34:08.524 --> 00:34:11.440
[Dale]So they put him next to the Trade Towers disintegrating.

709
00:34:11.484 --> 00:34:15.140
They put swastikas all over him and Nazified Pepe.

710
00:34:15.183 --> 00:34:17.098
And it sort of snowballs.

711
00:34:17.142 --> 00:34:20.101
Back then, it was just the most offensive thing you could do.

712
00:34:20.145 --> 00:34:22.147
But it now reads
as a weird prologue

713
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.584
to when the irony
kind of melted away.

714
00:34:27.978 --> 00:34:29.980
There are people
on these platforms who believe

715
00:34:30.024 --> 00:34:33.549
that because you've couched
your intention in a joke,

716
00:34:33.593 --> 00:34:35.464
that you can disavow it
when people come asking.

717
00:34:35.508 --> 00:34:37.510
That's right.
That's exactly right.

718
00:34:37.553 --> 00:34:39.947
So you create this ambiguity
so there's no way for you

719
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:41.296
to mean
what you really mean ever.

720
00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.255
Yeah.

721
00:34:43.298 --> 00:34:45.474
I think what's appealing
about Pepe

722
00:34:45.518 --> 00:34:48.303
is that he combines
this impossible mixture

723
00:34:48.347 --> 00:34:50.218
of innocence and evil.

724
00:34:50.262 --> 00:34:53.091

of knowing smile

725
00:34:53.134 --> 00:34:56.746
while he's performing acts
that are really atrocious.

726
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.922
It sort of fulfills the idea

727
00:34:58.966 --> 00:35:01.708
that we can say
these terrible things

728
00:35:01.751 --> 00:35:04.624
and just mean them as jokes
all the time.

729
00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:06.321
They're always just jokes
all the time

730
00:35:06.365 --> 00:35:08.932
and you can't prove otherwise.

[Joel] We're just a bunch
of kids in our underwear.

It's harmless.
No one really means it.

733
00:35:13.502 --> 00:35:16.288
The problem, I think, is that
it's really demonstrable

734
00:35:16.331 --> 00:35:20.596
in the worst cases
that this isn't funny.

735

where he was

really divorced from reality.

make an effort.

758
00:36:02.769 --> 00:36:05.554
Didn't talk to anybody.
And he was so closed off

759
00:36:05.598 --> 00:36:07.426
and it was like when he was
sitting there,

760
00:36:07.469 --> 00:36:09.819
you can just tell he's just
thinking these thoughts

00:36:09.863 --> 00:36:12.387

He's just talking to himself.

to 4chan that day.

People in this environment
were starting to get whipped up

"Yeah, that's right.

You showed him who's boss."

You know, he, he went out there.

He stood up for being,

The very first picture

of the very first ones

and put it into like a,

00:40:40.655 --> 00:40:43.179
it was fairly skeptical.

872

a lot of these things in his rhetoric that they like.

a real life version of Pepe,

885
00:41:24.264 --> 00:41:27.006
in the ability to illicit

886
00:41:27.049 --> 00:41:29.487
a reaction and to get attention

887
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.446
and to express and to capture
peoples' hopes and fears.

888

I was formerly the
Director of Strategy and Data

for the Trump campaign,

890
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:42.195

about how to use voter data

891

than anybody else
in the country.

892
00:41:45.807 --> 00:41:47.200
During the campaign,

893
00:41:47.243 --> 00:41:50.420
there was an effort by 4chan

894
00:41:50.464 --> 00:41:52.814
to get other people
to support the president

895
00:41:52.858 --> 00:41:54.860
by creating memes.

896
00:41:54.903 --> 00:41:56.165
[Braynard]And then sharing them

897
00:41:56.209 --> 00:41:57.993
to say, normies,

898
00:41:58.037 --> 00:42:01.388
to try to motivate them
to support President Trump.

The inside terminology

900
00:42:04.434 --> 00:42:06.349
for this was
"The Great Meme War."

901
00:42:09.048 --> 00:42:11.224
It gave people who had never
really been involved

902
00:42:11.267 --> 00:42:12.573
in politics before

903
00:42:12.617 --> 00:42:13.618
a way in.

904
00:42:15.924 --> 00:42:17.186
[Braynard]
The best memes that you see,

905
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:18.710
the most effective ones,

906
00:42:18.753 --> 00:42:21.539
are just some person
who has no power at all.

907
00:42:21.582 --> 00:42:22.801
They have no influence,
they have no money,

908
00:42:22.844 --> 00:42:24.150
they have no connections.

909
00:42:24.193 --> 00:42:25.847
But if they can make
one good meme,

910
00:42:25.891 --> 00:42:27.545
they can take off and go viral.

911
00:42:29.111 --> 00:42:30.243
Then when you hypercharge it

912
00:42:30.286 --> 00:42:31.853
by having
the president retweet it,

913
00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:34.247
you felt like you were part
of this rebel group,

914
00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:35.988
this insurgency

915
00:42:36.031 --> 00:42:39.426
that was completely
unpredictable and from

where no one would have
ever expected it.

How does an image like this

918
00:42:44.083 --> 00:42:47.652
end up on Donald Trump's
Twitter account?

919
00:42:47.695 --> 00:42:50.480
[Dale] 4chan supported Trump
for a mix of reasons.

920
00:42:50.524 --> 00:42:52.657
Some of it I think
was this nihilistic idea

921
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.180
that Trump was a wrecking ball.

922
00:42:54.223 --> 00:42:56.443
And that they wanted
to embarrass people

923
00:42:56.486 --> 00:42:57.923
by electing him.

924
00:42:57.966 --> 00:42:59.620
[Dale] And so when Trump
retweeted himself

925
00:42:59.664 --> 00:43:01.404
depicted as Pepe,

926
00:43:01.448 --> 00:43:03.711
it was like
this watershed moment.

927
00:43:06.409 --> 00:43:08.716
[reporter #2] This is Donald Trump co-opting the idea

928
00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:12.590
of himself, uh, sort of substituted as Pepe.

929
00:43:12.633 --> 00:43:14.461

It was so transgressive,

so anti-PC.

To most of the voters out there, it just seemed kind of odd.

But, if you were
part of the community

933
00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.036
that has been spending years
and years, and years

934
00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:25.124
using Pepe,

suddenly,

A meme can become the anchor

949
00:44:08.602 --> 00:44:10.038
or the seed, if you will,

950
00:44:10.082 --> 00:44:13.041
around which a group of
like-minded people can gather

951
00:44:13.085 --> 00:44:14.652
and toward which
they can focus their energy.

952
00:44:14.695 --> 00:44:17.045
That's a basic tool
of meme magic.

953
00:44:17.089 --> 00:44:19.700
And that's one of the things
we saw during the 2016 Election.

954
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:24.357
[suspenseful music]

955
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.707
[Greer] The way that magic
was used on the Chans was

956
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:31.103
they focused on building up
a series of hypersigils,

957
00:44:31.146 --> 00:44:34.236
-of images like Pepe the Frog.
-[lightning crackles]

958
00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.718
[Greer] And piled into
those images,

959
00:44:37.762 --> 00:44:39.546
all of their hopes and
all of their energy,

960
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:41.548
their emotional focus

961
00:44:41.591 --> 00:44:44.246
of seeing Donald Trump
in the White House.

962
00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:46.814
You ended up with a lot of people on the Chans just going,

963
00:44:46.858 --> 00:44:48.773
"Wow, I could do this."

964
00:44:52.864 --> 00:44:54.996

[crowd clamoring]

967
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:08.836
It's not Republicanism
as we have known it.

968
00:45:12.231 --> 00:45:15.451
These are racist ideas,
race baiting ideas.

969
00:45:15.495 --> 00:45:19.020
Anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant,

970
00:45:19.064 --> 00:45:22.589
anti-women. All key tenants
making up the emerging

971
00:45:22.632 --> 00:45:23.851
racist ideology

972
00:45:23.895 --> 00:45:26.288
known as the alt-right.

973
00:45:26.332 --> 00:45:27.637
[man in crowd] Pepe!

974
00:45:27.681 --> 00:45:30.989
Now, alt-right is short for
alternative-right.

975
00:45:31.032 --> 00:45:33.252
The Wall Street Journal
describes it

976
00:45:33.295 --> 00:45:35.950
as a loose and racist ideology

977
00:45:35.994 --> 00:45:38.170
known as the alt-right.

978
00:45:38.213 --> 00:45:39.475
[man in crowd] Pepe!

979
00:45:39.519 --> 00:45:40.738
Pepe!

980
00:45:42.174 --> 00:45:43.566
And, and to most people,

981
00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:46.787
that was a totally inexplicable
thing at the moment.

982
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:48.006
It must be totally random.

983
00:45:48.049 --> 00:45:50.138
To the white supremacist
anti-Semitic

984
00:45:50.182 --> 00:45:51.836
neo-Nazi right in this country,

985
00:45:51.879 --> 00:45:54.012
that was a moment of triumph.

986
00:45:55.187 --> 00:45:57.145
[keyboard clacking]

987
00:45:59.887 --> 00:46:02.672
Suddenly, Pepe the meme,
the most...

988
00:46:02.716 --> 00:46:05.675
silliest piece of
meaningless culture,

989
00:46:05.719 --> 00:46:08.896
was sort of like
passing through the screen.

990
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.029
[Dale] It was kinda like
the dream of the troll,

991
00:46:11.072 --> 00:46:12.421
making the Internet real.

[suspenseful music]

993
00:46:22.692 --> 00:46:24.912
It was becoming like,

994
00:46:24.956 --> 00:46:27.567
you know, weird to, like,
have this tattoo.

995
00:46:32.224 --> 00:46:34.400
You're here
to get me involved in your...

Is this... this better be
about Landwolf.

1001
00:46:46.151 --> 00:46:47.674
[Skinner] Duck your head.

1002
00:46:47.717 --> 00:46:49.241
Please don't kick my cat.

1003
00:46:50.503 --> 00:46:52.200
If, if you can help it.

1004
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.507
[guitar chimes]

1005
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:56.422
That... I think it's funny
that, like...

1006
00:46:56.465 --> 00:46:59.468
that Chris got the Pepe tattooed
on his arm and he was like,

1007
00:46:59.512 --> 00:47:01.035
-"I have to hide it now."
-[laughing]

1008
00:47:01.079 --> 00:47:03.733
"Somebody at Subway thought
I was a white power dude."

1009
00:47:03.777 --> 00:47:05.387
-Yeah. Everybody...
-[laughs]

1010
00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:06.867
everybody's actually very...

1011
00:47:06.911 --> 00:47:08.651
everybody's
very excited about Pepe.

1012
00:47:08.695 --> 00:47:10.262
They're like, "Oh wow,
Pepe's this awesome meme, dude."

1013
00:47:10.305 --> 00:47:11.350
[Skinner] He rules.

1014
00:47:11.393 --> 00:47:12.917
-Yeah.
-"Wow, you made Pepe?"

1015
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.310
I was like all proud of myself,
strutting down the street,

1016
00:47:15.354 --> 00:47:17.182
-you know.
-[snaps fingers]

1017
00:47:17.225 --> 00:47:19.488
[Skinner] Now people
just throw rocks at you.

1018
00:47:19.532 --> 00:47:21.360
"That's the guy
who created Pepe!"

1019
00:47:21.403 --> 00:47:22.883
-Yeah. -[Skinner]You're not strutting

1020
00:47:22.927 --> 00:47:24.450
-anymore, are ya? Sicko!
-[Matt] No, I'm not.

1021
00:47:24.493 --> 00:47:25.886
Now I'm, now I'm like

1022
00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:28.193
just slithering down the street

1023
00:47:28.236 --> 00:47:31.326
in a pool of my own waste
or something.

1024
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:32.937
-[Skinner] Whoa, like a...
-[Matt] Yeah.

1025
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.503
-Like a slug lord.
-Like a...

1026
00:47:34.547 --> 00:47:37.376
Just a... a slurping slimeball.

1027
00:47:37.419 --> 00:47:39.334
[Skinner] But
I really do feel like

1028
00:47:39.378 --> 00:47:41.815
this would only happen to you.

1029
00:47:43.034 --> 00:47:44.774
[slime rustling]

1030
00:47:44.818 --> 00:47:45.906
[squelches]

1031
00:47:50.302 --> 00:47:53.479
[Adam]I interviewed Matt Furie in September 2016

1032
00:47:53.522 --> 00:47:55.176
with The Atlantic.

1033
00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:58.397
My impression of Furie was that
he was very well intentioned,

1034
00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.313
but somewhat naive about
the extent to which

1035
00:48:01.356 --> 00:48:04.925
this symbol had been
appropriated by the far right.

1036
00:48:04.969 --> 00:48:07.536
[reporter #3] Pepe is a white nationalist symbol...

1037
00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:08.886
[reporter #4]
...increasingly being used

1038
00:48:08.929 --> 00:48:10.191
by white supremacists...

1039
00:48:10.235 --> 00:48:12.846
It's something of a mascot
by the alt-right.

1040
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.588
[Adam] Defining the alt-right
is somewhat easier these days.

1041
00:48:15.631 --> 00:48:17.285
But around 2016,

1042
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:18.547
it encompassed a lot of people

1043
00:48:18.591 --> 00:48:20.680
who were ideologically
opposed to the left

1044
00:48:20.723 --> 00:48:23.117
but not necessarily united
on every issue.

1045
00:48:23.161 --> 00:48:24.902
And then you've got people
like Richard Spencer

1046
00:48:24.945 --> 00:48:26.555
who are overt
white nationalists.

1047
00:48:26.599 --> 00:48:29.602
[Spencer]

1048
00:48:31.691 --> 00:48:34.041
[Adam] But the alt-right Pepe
allows them

1049
00:48:34.085 --> 00:48:35.260
to pretend that they're kidding.

1050
00:48:35.303 --> 00:48:36.478
They're not kidding.

1051
00:48:36.522 --> 00:48:38.567
What they want is for you to be

1052
00:48:38.611 --> 00:48:40.134
both scared by the threat

1053
00:48:40.178 --> 00:48:43.572
and be mocked for being scared
in the first place.

1054
00:48:43.616 --> 00:48:45.966
The point is to cause that
kind of psychic anguish

1055
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:48.534
and then they draw a great deal
of pleasure from that.

1056
00:48:48.577 --> 00:48:50.797
Basically alt-right
is a big tent

1057
00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.277
or rather a big rock

1058
00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.932
under which creeps
a diverse assortment of

1059
00:48:54.975 --> 00:48:57.673
paleo conservatives,
men's rights misogynists...

1060
00:48:57.717 --> 00:49:01.416
I remember I went to
a taping of Sam Bee.

1061
00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:05.333
And she had a segment about
Pepe the Frog.

1062
00:49:05.377 --> 00:49:07.727
And I got to meet her
after the taping.

1063
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:09.381
And good
old-fashioned neo-Nazis.

1064
00:49:09.424 --> 00:49:10.730
And I was like, "You know,

1065
00:49:10.773 --> 00:49:12.950
Pepe was actually created by
a friend of mine

1066
00:49:12.993 --> 00:49:14.473
and he's a really sweet artist

1067
00:49:14.516 --> 00:49:16.779
and, and it doesn't mean
this thing that it,

1068
00:49:16.823 --> 00:49:18.172
it transformed into,

1069
00:49:18.216 --> 00:49:20.783
and she was just,
sort of like, "Okay."

1070
00:49:20.827 --> 00:49:23.438
The alt-right's use of Pepe
just drowned out

1071
00:49:23.482 --> 00:49:25.571
any other visual interpretation,

1072
00:49:25.614 --> 00:49:29.053
you know, Trump's former campaign chair Steve Bannon said

1073
00:49:29.096 --> 00:49:31.403
the Democrats
are not the opposition party,

1074
00:49:31.446 --> 00:49:33.013
the media
is the opposition party

1075
00:49:33.057 --> 00:49:34.319
and how do you beat the media?

1076
00:49:34.362 --> 00:49:35.755
You flood the zone with shit.

1077
00:49:35.798 --> 00:49:37.626
Well, these people
are flooding the zone with shit

1078
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:40.151
so that you don't know
what's real or what's not.

1079
00:49:42.153 --> 00:49:44.198
[Alex] I mean quite frankly
I've been to the events.

1080
00:49:44.242 --> 00:49:45.634
It wasn't even real.

1081
00:49:45.678 --> 00:49:47.288
Literally,
they're just Jewish actors.

1082
00:49:47.332 --> 00:49:49.160
A lot of the KKK guys
with their hats off

1083
00:49:49.203 --> 00:49:52.206
literally looks like
the cast of Seinfeld...

1084
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:54.774
[Adam] A conspiracy theorist
like Alex Jones

1085
00:49:54.817 --> 00:49:56.167
appeals to Trump because

1086
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.212
one of Trump's
major political tools

1087
00:49:58.256 --> 00:50:01.781
is forcing people to reject
objective reality

1088
00:50:01.824 --> 00:50:03.870
in favor of
his version of reality.

1089
00:50:03.913 --> 00:50:05.132
[Alex] Well, Donald Trump,
let me say this.

1090
00:50:05.176 --> 00:50:07.439
You are the leading presidential
frontrunner

1091
00:50:07.482 --> 00:50:09.093
with the Republicans

1092
00:50:09.136 --> 00:50:11.269
gaining a huge lead as you don't
back down, but I got to just...

1093
00:50:11.312 --> 00:50:13.619
And the point of it is to
obliterate objective truth.

1094
00:50:13.662 --> 00:50:15.055
[man on megaphone] Fake news!

00:54:48.633 --> 00:54:50.896
Matt's name
was in the description

1097
00:54:50.939 --> 00:54:52.593
about it on the website.

00:54:52.637 --> 00:54:55.074
- -It's like a nightmare.

with this weird new swastika.

1103
00:55:06.868 --> 00:55:08.566
Matt Furie
put out a statement

1104
00:55:08.609 --> 00:55:10.263
to the Associated Press.
He said that he was horrified

1105
00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:11.830
to see his creation
become a mascot

1106
00:55:11.873 --> 00:55:13.614
for the alt-right
fringe movement.

1107
00:55:13.658 --> 00:55:15.399
I don't want to
be associated with this.

1108
00:55:15.442 --> 00:55:17.314
You know, I'm, like, trying
to write children's books.

1109
00:55:19.359 --> 00:55:21.622
The nature of the media
and politics and stuff that

1110
00:55:21.666 --> 00:55:25.234
I've been trying to escape
from my entire life.

1111
00:55:25.278 --> 00:55:26.975
I don't give a shit
about any of that stuff.

1112
00:55:27.019 --> 00:55:29.674
Then I got pulled into it
just because...

1113
00:55:29.717 --> 00:55:32.720
I'm on a hate symbol
database list now

1114
00:55:32.764 --> 00:55:34.243
and it pissed me off.

1115
00:55:43.818 --> 00:55:47.561
As the news was going on
that this Internet frog

1116
00:55:47.605 --> 00:55:49.868
has been marked
as like a hate symbol,

1117
00:55:49.911 --> 00:55:52.349
that's when I got
the phone call from our buyer.

1118
00:55:52.392 --> 00:55:53.741
They pulled it
right away.

1119
00:55:53.785 --> 00:55:56.483
So, we have about 3,000 items

1120
00:55:56.527 --> 00:56:00.226
that were going to go
into 580 stores across the U.S.

1121
00:56:00.269 --> 00:56:03.708
and now it's in my garage. So...

1122
00:56:03.751 --> 00:56:06.232
These were probably,
like, $15 each to make.

1123
00:56:06.275 --> 00:56:08.408
If you think of 15 times 3,000,

1124
00:56:08.452 --> 00:56:10.367
like, it's pretty crazy.

1125
00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:15.328
-Yeah it's 45,000 dollars.
- Yup.

1126
00:56:15.372 --> 00:56:17.417
We didn't want
to give it to Goodwill.

1127
00:56:17.461 --> 00:56:19.158
We didn't want
to sell it ourselves

1128
00:56:19.201 --> 00:56:20.942
because we're afraid...

1129
00:56:20.986 --> 00:56:24.337
white supremacists
would wear it and then...

1130
00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:27.906
What is that worth versus
putting out a hate symbol?

1131
00:56:27.949 --> 00:56:29.908
And I'm sure you feel
the same way.

1132
00:56:31.518 --> 00:56:35.087
A lot of the merchandise
ended up having to be destroyed.

1133
00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:36.654
Yeah, now,
that's kind of the least

1134
00:56:36.697 --> 00:56:37.872
-of my worries.
- I know.

1135
00:56:41.136 --> 00:56:42.573
He was a dummy.

1136
00:56:42.616 --> 00:56:44.836
He just kinda let his character get away from him

1137
00:56:44.879 --> 00:56:47.404
and now, this shit happened.

1138
00:56:47.447 --> 00:56:51.843
Matt is just like most of us,
a poor, cartooning loser.

1139
00:56:51.886 --> 00:56:55.368
I was suggesting that he sue
the Anti-Defamation League

1140
00:56:55.412 --> 00:56:57.414
for defamation.

1141
00:57:03.942 --> 00:57:06.205
I'm just trying
to be positive.

1142
00:57:06.248 --> 00:57:09.382
Not everybody has a platform to talk about this kinda stuff.

1143
00:57:10.992 --> 00:57:13.473
I teamed up with the ADL

1144
00:57:13.517 --> 00:57:16.476
to just try to offer people
some creative solutions.

1145
00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:18.478
-Hi, everybody.

1146
00:57:19.653 --> 00:57:21.046
Um...

1147
00:57:22.395 --> 00:57:24.049
So what we're trying to do now

1148
00:57:24.092 --> 00:57:26.791
is to start
a Save Pepe campaign.

1149
00:57:26.834 --> 00:57:30.185
-And uh...

1150
00:57:32.666 --> 00:57:33.885
I invite everybody

1151
00:57:33.928 --> 00:57:36.844
to draw their own
peaceful version of Pepe

1152
00:57:36.888 --> 00:57:40.587
and share it on social media
with the hashtag "savepepe."

1153
00:57:41.849 --> 00:57:43.590
Can we turn something

1154
00:57:43.634 --> 00:57:45.810
that's become a recognized
hate symbol

1155
00:57:45.853 --> 00:57:48.029
into a recognized love symbol?

1156
00:57:52.294 --> 00:57:54.471
It was really funny,
but it was also really lovely.

1157
00:57:54.514 --> 00:57:56.429
-Like I tweeted about it. I...
-Yeah.

1158
00:57:56.473 --> 00:57:58.823
-I tried to help. I, like...
-Yeah. I drew a Pepe.

1159
00:57:58.866 --> 00:58:02.304
Part of
the Save Pepe campaign.

1160
00:58:02.348 --> 00:58:05.482
I'm like, damn, he's kind of
going through a situation

1161
00:58:05.525 --> 00:58:08.093
that isn't right
and I want to help him out.

1162
00:58:11.139 --> 00:58:12.184
Does that look like Pepe?

1163
00:58:14.969 --> 00:58:16.580
I've never drawn Pepe before,

1164
00:58:16.623 --> 00:58:19.017
but I figured I'm going to do
whatever I can to help

1165
00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.846
because I'm such
a big fan of Matt's, and...

1166
00:58:21.889 --> 00:58:24.718
So, I'm butchering
Pepe here, but...

1167
00:58:24.762 --> 00:58:25.850
something like that.

1168
00:58:26.981 --> 00:58:28.592
In Matt's work,

1169
00:58:28.635 --> 00:58:31.986
I can feel his love
for nature and the universe.

1170
00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.294
I was like, "Oh, yeah,
Matt's my buddy, you know.

1171
00:58:35.337 --> 00:58:37.383
I like Pepe, so, I just
kind of, like, you know...

1172
00:58:37.426 --> 00:58:39.646
I made a Peace Frog Pepe,
you know.

1173
00:58:41.169 --> 00:58:42.780
Does that look like Pepe?

1174
00:58:44.738 --> 00:58:46.305
It's getting less
and less like Pepe.

1175
00:58:50.048 --> 00:58:52.093
I've been working on
it for about a month now

1176
00:58:52.137 --> 00:58:55.009
and I've gotten
about 500 and counting

1177
00:58:55.053 --> 00:58:57.403
brand new peace Pepes.

1178
00:58:57.446 --> 00:59:01.276
My goal with this
is to eventually start something

1179
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:04.932
that I'd like to call
the Peace Pepe Database of Love.

1180
00:59:07.935 --> 00:59:10.068
My whole thing is
just to focus on positive

1181
00:59:10.111 --> 00:59:11.504
and just keep being creative.

1182
00:59:27.215 --> 00:59:29.174
The attempt
by Matt Furie

1183
00:59:29.217 --> 00:59:31.872
to wrest control over Pepe,

1184
00:59:31.916 --> 00:59:33.613
it seems like he understands
the Internet

1185
00:59:33.657 --> 00:59:35.746
about as well
as Hillary Clinton does.

1186
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:40.620
Maybe if the original artwork
wasn't so pedestrian and basic

1187
00:59:40.664 --> 00:59:42.666
that an eight year old
can draw Pepe.

1188
00:59:42.709 --> 00:59:45.843
A scribbling
that was improved upon by others

1189
00:59:45.886 --> 00:59:48.367
that was given meaning
that it never had before,

1190
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:51.109
I would just
encourage Matt to...

1191
00:59:51.152 --> 00:59:54.025
you know, just be glad
to have been a small part

1192
00:59:54.068 --> 00:59:55.113
of a very big thing.

1193
00:59:57.985 --> 01:00:00.901
Art is supposed to be
therapeutic, so, uh...

1194
01:00:00.945 --> 01:00:02.860
before Trump got elected,

1195
01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:06.733
I just did this kind of, like,
nightmare scenario of Pepe,

1196
01:00:06.777 --> 01:00:09.170
like slowly morphing
into Donald Trump

1197
01:00:09.214 --> 01:00:11.172
and then into a monster
and then,

1198
01:00:11.216 --> 01:00:13.348
uh, being trapped inside
the monster's mouth,

1199
01:00:13.392 --> 01:00:15.220
as you can see, and, uh...

1200
01:00:15.263 --> 01:00:16.482
It's like a nuclear war.

1201
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:28.407
This is
the new American moment.

1202
01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:32.498
This is like Martin-Luther-King- I-have-a-dream speech.

1203
01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:36.763
It's like Washington
crossing the Delaware

1204
01:00:36.807 --> 01:00:40.114
♪ We are the champions

1205
01:00:45.859 --> 01:00:47.382
We were all ecstatic.

1206
01:00:50.734 --> 01:00:53.475
Donald Trump, he
wasn't supposed to be there.

1207
01:00:53.519 --> 01:00:54.999
We all felt, like,

1208
01:00:55.042 --> 01:00:58.785
the meming had played a part
in the election.

1209
01:00:58.829 --> 01:01:02.920
The Internet's joke
kind of came to fruition.

1210
01:01:14.888 --> 01:01:18.239
The chaotic scene just blocks outside the secure

1211
01:01:18.283 --> 01:01:20.546
of the inauguration
and parade routes.

1212
01:01:22.548 --> 01:01:24.115
-What?

1213
01:01:24.158 --> 01:01:26.595
It's Pepe.
He's become kind of a symbol...

1214
01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:50.707
After the election,
Matt just came to me and said,

1215
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.361
"Hey, I'm going to draw
a comic strip with Pepe in it

1216
01:01:53.405 --> 01:01:55.233
and I'm going to kill him."

1217
01:01:55.276 --> 01:01:58.845
The Pepe thing was so
out of control at that point

1218
01:01:58.889 --> 01:02:01.587
and whatever Pepe meant
to all these other people

1219
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:03.415
didn't mean
the same thing to me.

1220
01:02:04.329 --> 01:02:05.547
So I just killed him.

1221
01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.335
I just thought it'd be
funny to do a comic strip

1222
01:02:10.378 --> 01:02:12.119
where all the boys
are at his funeral.

1223
01:02:13.338 --> 01:02:14.861

1237
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:23.712
I didn't think it'd
get noticed or anything.

1238
01:03:23.756 --> 01:03:24.844
I'm sure you recognize

1239
01:03:24.888 --> 01:03:26.454
the cartoon character
Pepe the Frog.

1240
01:03:26.498 --> 01:03:28.326
Well, he won't be around so much longer

1241
01:03:28.369 --> 01:03:31.155
because his creator has decided to kill him off.

1242
01:03:31.198 --> 01:03:33.766
A carton frog died
on the Internet.

1243
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.855
His name was Pepe.

1244
01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:38.597
It seemed like every time
he drew Pepe,

1245
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.729
he would get
hounded by reporters.

1246
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:46.605
- He just hated it.

1247
01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:56.658
When I had first seen
Matt's death of Pepe comic,

1248
01:03:56.702 --> 01:03:58.878
I was honestly a bit sad.

1249
01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:01.881
But the Pepe we see,
unfortunately,

1250
01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.883
has been so far removed
from the original...

1251
01:04:03.927 --> 01:04:06.843
that the Pepe Matt was killing
was his own.

1252
01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:21.335
The burden
of this weird Pepe shit

1253
01:04:21.379 --> 01:04:24.991
was starting to make me feel
anxious and weird.

1254
01:04:29.126 --> 01:04:31.650
Maybe it is
whatever people say it is.

1255
01:04:31.693 --> 01:04:34.131
Like I can't fucking control it, you know.

1256
01:04:40.137 --> 01:04:43.183
♪ The power that's inside

1257
01:04:43.227 --> 01:04:45.403
♪ Pokemon!
Gotta catch 'em all! ♪

1258
01:04:45.446 --> 01:04:47.448
♪ It's you and me

1259
01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:57.284
Owning a rare Pepe
is about being alpha.

1260
01:04:57.328 --> 01:05:02.115
It's about having dank,
rare Pepes nobody else has.

1261
01:05:02.159 --> 01:05:05.118
And it's about how do we
get to the moon in a Lambo.

1262
01:05:07.077 --> 01:05:08.556
Okay, let's pull it up.

1263
01:05:09.949 --> 01:05:11.995
I'm in these crypto forums,

1264
01:05:12.038 --> 01:05:13.866
and for the longest time,

1265
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:16.216
these guys would talk
about Pepe Cash.

1266
01:05:17.478 --> 01:05:19.132
Some huge guys,

1267
01:05:19.176 --> 01:05:21.961
like, seven to eight figure
portfolio crypto guys.

1268
01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.007
And I look at the website,
I'm like, "What?

1269
01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:25.965
What the fuck
are they talking about?"

1270
01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:27.010
What is it?

1271
01:05:31.362 --> 01:05:33.755
So I actually am a Pepe Cash millionaire.

1272
01:05:34.974 --> 01:05:36.106
How many million is that?

1273
01:05:36.149 --> 01:05:38.195
Is that 363 million?

1274
01:05:38.238 --> 01:05:42.025
Ah, 363 million Internet Pepe.

1275
01:05:42.068 --> 01:05:43.374
You know, I like that.

1276
01:05:45.202 --> 01:05:47.639
This is when
we christened the SS Rare Pepe

1277
01:05:47.682 --> 01:05:50.555
which I bought with Pepe Cash
and I live on it.

1278
01:05:52.426 --> 01:05:55.212
If you want to explain
the rare Pepe economy,

1279
01:05:55.255 --> 01:05:58.302
imagine a few dozen geeks
on the Internet

1280
01:05:58.345 --> 01:06:02.132
came up with a way to trade
memes off 4chan

1281
01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:05.396
and lock them into ownership.

1282
01:06:05.439 --> 01:06:07.789
There are some Pepes
that are superhero knockoffs.

1283
01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:10.879
You know, Iron Man Pepes,
Spiderman Pepes.

1284
01:06:10.923 --> 01:06:13.273
Some people's heroes
are more political in nature.

1285
01:06:13.317 --> 01:06:14.753
Trump Pepe,

1286
01:06:14.796 --> 01:06:16.581
which is awesome,
because he's just like,

1287
01:06:16.624 --> 01:06:18.452
"Make crypto great again,
whether you like it or not."

1288
01:06:20.498 --> 01:06:21.934
It's much different
than comic books,

1289
01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.718
or even collectible
baseball cards

1290
01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:28.767
because it exists as math
on the Internet first...

1291
01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:32.553
and then later you can print
the physical copy of it.

1292
01:06:32.597 --> 01:06:35.295
This is the physical card.
This is worthless.

1293
01:06:35.339 --> 01:06:36.993
This is the thing that's worth

1294
01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:38.690
hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

1295
01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:42.868
So, I was going
to this digital arts conference

1296
01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:44.957
called Rare AF. Rare As Fuck.

1297
01:06:46.828 --> 01:06:48.178
Luckily for me,

1298
01:06:48.221 --> 01:06:51.485
they're having the world's
first rare Pepe auction.

1299
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:53.009
Rare Pepe after rare Pepe

1300
01:06:53.052 --> 01:06:55.054
after beautiful rare Pepe
passing by

1301
01:06:55.098 --> 01:06:57.013
and then finally
gets to the end.

1302
01:06:57.056 --> 01:06:59.232
It's the ultimate rare Pepe.

1303
01:06:59.276 --> 01:07:00.625
The Homer Pepe.

1304
01:07:03.236 --> 01:07:04.803
And I'm like,
"I'm getting this thing."

1305
01:07:04.846 --> 01:07:05.978
Homer for 200.

1306
01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.284
- Homer!
-Two hundred.

1307
01:07:07.327 --> 01:07:08.589
People start placing bids.

1308
01:07:08.633 --> 01:07:11.070
Twenty, 30, 40,
100,000 Pepe Cash.

1309
01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:12.724
Two hundred thousand Pepe Cash.

1310
01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:14.073
- Two seventy-five.
- Two seventy.

1311
01:07:14.117 --> 01:07:15.640
It starts getting
so crazy

1312
01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:18.338
and it gets
to 350,000 Pepe Cash.

1313
01:07:18.382 --> 01:07:21.515
Which is about
39,000 US dollars.

1314
01:07:21.559 --> 01:07:24.214
Three hundred fifty going once,
going twice.

1315
01:07:24.257 --> 01:07:25.954
- Uh-oh!
-Sold!

1316
01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:31.134
What inspired you
to pay 39,000 US dollars

1317
01:07:31.177 --> 01:07:33.832
-for a rare Pepe?
-I'm just excited about Pepe.

1318
01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:34.876
Okay.

1319
01:07:36.226 --> 01:07:37.531
So this is Homer Pepe.

1320
01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:42.188
Currently the world's
most valuable rare Pepe.

1321
01:07:43.494 --> 01:07:46.758
Now what makes
this Pepe worth so much?

1322
01:07:46.801 --> 01:07:49.326
It's the only one
with a misprint.

1323
01:07:49.369 --> 01:07:53.330
Wait a minute.
"Wait a mintue. Wait a mintue."

1324
01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:54.374
That's value.

1325
01:08:25.753 --> 01:08:27.015
You're Matt, right?

1326
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:32.195
You have gainfully employed
all of us.

1327
01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:38.157
So, uh...
What are you guys talking about?

1328
01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:41.029
We're all working
the general realm of, you know,

1329
01:08:41.073 --> 01:08:44.424
weird online behavior
from a scientific perspective.

1330
01:08:44.468 --> 01:08:47.166
We have, uh,
security people from the U.S.

1331
01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:49.342
We have cryptographers
from the U.K.

1332
01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:52.171
We have systems people
from, uh, mainland Europe

1333
01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:54.565
and we take a large scale
analysis of data,

1334
01:08:54.608 --> 01:08:57.002
getting a quantitative
understanding of hate speech

1335
01:08:57.045 --> 01:08:58.090
throughout the web.

1336
01:08:59.483 --> 01:09:01.049
We had to figure out a way

1337
01:09:01.093 --> 01:09:03.182
to be able to measure
this stuff at large scale

1338
01:09:03.226 --> 01:09:07.578
and we ended up building
a system to measure memes.

1339
01:09:07.621 --> 01:09:09.754
Just to give you
an idea of the scale, Matt.

1340
01:09:09.797 --> 01:09:12.278
So we had over a billion posts

1341
01:09:12.322 --> 01:09:15.063
from Twitter, Reddit,
/pol/ and Gab.,

1342
01:09:15.107 --> 01:09:18.197
and we examined the 160 million
some odd images.

1343
01:09:18.241 --> 01:09:19.851
So obviously,
these weren't all Pepes,

1344
01:09:19.894 --> 01:09:22.375
but the scale of this data
is huge.

1345
01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:24.508
-This is only for a year.
-Interesting.

1346
01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:26.597
There's a variety
of different memes,

1347
01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.774
but there tends to be
a Pepe variant

1348
01:09:29.817 --> 01:09:31.863
in every single one
of these clusters. So...

1349
01:09:31.906 --> 01:09:33.343
You pick a random meme

1350
01:09:33.386 --> 01:09:35.258
and Pepe has been
inserted into it

1351
01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:37.695
in some way, shape or form.

1352
01:09:37.738 --> 01:09:39.871
In a lot of ways,
Pepe becomes an entry point

1353
01:09:39.914 --> 01:09:41.612
to radicalization.

1354
01:09:41.655 --> 01:09:43.875
That's a very scary thing
to think about.

1355
01:09:43.918 --> 01:09:47.444
Do you feel any
personal responsibility for...

1356
01:09:47.487 --> 01:09:49.097
the bad stuff
that has come out of this?

1357
01:09:50.142 --> 01:09:51.230
I mean, you shouldn't,

1358
01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:52.318
but you know,
we're humans, right?

1359
01:09:52.362 --> 01:09:53.406
We feel guilt
for things

1360
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:55.234
that we shouldn't feel
guilt for.

1361
01:09:55.278 --> 01:09:58.237
Um, I'm... I mean, uh,

1362
01:09:58.281 --> 01:10:00.718
maybe I could have been
more proactive earlier on

1363
01:10:00.761 --> 01:10:02.285
-to, like, try to control it.
-Yeah.

1364
01:10:02.328 --> 01:10:04.243
So, the question of,
"Can you get Pepe back?"

1365
01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:06.289
The reality is that
there is, you know,

1366
01:10:06.332 --> 01:10:09.988
160 million memes, essentially,
in a year, that we collected.

1367
01:10:10.031 --> 01:10:11.119
Not all of them
were Pepes again,

1368
01:10:11.163 --> 01:10:12.730
but a good chunk of them are.

1369
01:10:12.773 --> 01:10:14.775
That's a tough genie
to put back in the bottle.

1370
01:10:14.819 --> 01:10:16.777
Um, yeah. I wish you luck.

1371
01:10:16.821 --> 01:10:18.344
I do.

1372
01:10:18.388 --> 01:10:19.389
Sincerely.

1373
01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:25.046
So...

1374
01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:27.397
I try to stay positive,
you know.

1375
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.007
But to be honest, I...

1376
01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:30.095
I've gotten trolled.

1377
01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:32.837
Somebody sent me this.

1378
01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.143
I don't take it personally

1379
01:10:35.187 --> 01:10:38.756
even though
I'm having my head decapitated.

1380
01:10:38.799 --> 01:10:40.845
It is what it is
what it is, right?

1381
01:10:41.585 --> 01:10:42.586
Um...

1382
01:10:45.937 --> 01:10:48.722
It's not like wearing
on kind of, like, my spirit.

1383
01:10:48.766 --> 01:10:51.595
But it's kind of wearing
on my drive to be creative.

1384
01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:59.559
It did manifest anxieties that
I have yet to unravel.

1385
01:11:01.039 --> 01:11:03.259
He just kinda
slept a lot and, uh...

1386
01:11:05.217 --> 01:11:08.002
You know, honestly it was
kinda like hard to talk to him.

1387
01:11:09.395 --> 01:11:11.354
You know, I let him know
I was there for him

1388
01:11:11.397 --> 01:11:12.659
and all that, but, like,

1389
01:11:12.703 --> 01:11:15.619
there wasn't anything
anyone could really do.

1390
01:11:17.838 --> 01:11:20.232
Tonight a Denton ISD assistant principal

1391
01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:23.279
is coming under fire for writing a new children's book.

1392
01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:25.542
A book, some say,
is politically motivated.

1393
01:11:25.585 --> 01:11:27.805
I'm using Pepe just as
a lighthearted way

1394
01:11:27.848 --> 01:11:31.112
of expressing maybe some
conservative, uh, values.

1395
01:11:32.331 --> 01:11:33.898
If you love America,

1396
01:11:33.941 --> 01:11:35.726
you're going to love this book
for sure.

1397
01:11:39.469 --> 01:11:40.905
When Matt found out

1398
01:11:40.948 --> 01:11:44.996
that there was an Islamophobic
racist children's book

1399
01:11:45.039 --> 01:11:49.305
starring Pepe coming out
on Amazon,

1400
01:11:49.957 --> 01:11:51.263
he was so upset.

1401
01:11:52.786 --> 01:11:57.356
And that's when he kind of...
freaked out about it.

1402
01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.010
It was, like,
the last straw.

1403
01:12:01.404 --> 01:12:04.624
It's like... It's like hell,
man. Like...

1404
01:12:04.668 --> 01:12:06.931
If you want to...
If you want to escape hell,

1405
01:12:06.974 --> 01:12:08.193
you can't ignore it.

1406
01:12:08.236 --> 01:12:09.977
You almost have to go
to the center of it.

1407
01:12:20.423 --> 01:12:22.294
It is not very often

1408
01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:24.601
that nerdy intellectual
property lawyers

1409
01:12:24.644 --> 01:12:26.994
get asked to fight
the alt-right.

1410
01:12:27.038 --> 01:12:29.214
But when we do, we're ready.

1411
01:12:33.436 --> 01:12:35.525
I have a whole team
of lawyers

1412
01:12:35.568 --> 01:12:37.396
that are working with me
pro bono

1413
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.398
and have really
empowered me to feel

1414
01:12:39.442 --> 01:12:42.183
like I do have some say
in all this.

1415
01:12:45.056 --> 01:12:48.668
He really wanted to prevent
the digital release of the book.

1416
01:12:48.712 --> 01:12:51.410
Inside it was, in fact,

1417
01:12:51.454 --> 01:12:53.499
a not so veiled reference
to a lot of alt-right themes.

1418
01:12:55.153 --> 01:12:57.068
We found out
who was publishing it

1419
01:12:57.111 --> 01:13:00.550
and explained that Matt Furie
owned the copyright to Pepe

1420
01:13:00.593 --> 01:13:04.510
and that we were prepared to enforce his rights in court.

1421
01:13:04.554 --> 01:13:06.425
The Adventures
of Pepe and Pede.

1422
01:13:06.469 --> 01:13:09.863
the electronic version
was never published.

1423
01:13:09.907 --> 01:13:13.824
But the issue here is,
when you shut down one person,

1424
01:13:13.867 --> 01:13:15.086
others pop up.

1425
01:13:17.262 --> 01:13:18.785
- You know,

1426
01:13:18.829 --> 01:13:22.136
I'm a compassionate guy
and I'm a sensitive guy.

1427
01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:24.661
But being able to work
with a team of lawyers

1428
01:13:24.704 --> 01:13:26.837
has given me strength to...

1429
01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.970
shut these assholes up.

1430
01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:32.582
You've been sued
by a frog, bro.

1431
01:13:32.625 --> 01:13:33.583
Do you even
know this yet?

1432
01:13:33.626 --> 01:13:34.845
No.

1433
01:13:34.888 --> 01:13:36.150
-It's all over the Internet.
-I'm surprised.

1434
01:13:36.194 --> 01:13:37.674
Surprise, motherfucker.
You got sued by a frog.

1435
01:13:37.717 --> 01:13:38.805
You've been sued
by a fucking' frog, dude.

1436
01:13:38.849 --> 01:13:42.026
A conspiracy frog named Pepe.

1437
01:13:42.069 --> 01:13:45.333
We did sell
a poster that a listener made

1438
01:13:45.377 --> 01:13:46.944
titled Make American Great Again

1439
01:13:46.987 --> 01:13:48.598
that had a bunch of images,

1440
01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:51.209
of symbols that were popular
during the campaign.

1441
01:13:51.252 --> 01:13:52.906
We talked
to our trademark lawyers

1442
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:56.475
and they said,"Mr. Jones,
this is so outrageous.

1443
01:13:56.519 --> 01:13:58.172
It's against
the First Amendment"

1444
01:13:58.216 --> 01:14:00.436
It is insane.

1445
01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:03.090
This is cockamamie balderdash.

1446
01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:06.833
He was selling a poster
with Pepe on it

1447
01:14:06.877 --> 01:14:08.182
with a bunch of douchebags

1448
01:14:08.226 --> 01:14:09.575
and I just didn't want him
to sell the poster.

1449
01:14:09.619 --> 01:14:11.359
The problem
isn't the drawing

1450
01:14:11.403 --> 01:14:14.101
or the making of the art,
you can do that.

1451
01:14:14.145 --> 01:14:17.365
It's just when
you mass produce it and sell it,

1452
01:14:17.409 --> 01:14:20.456
that's when it gets
into a stickier area.

1453
01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:23.023
He's like, "Yeah, the man's gonna stop us."

1454
01:14:23.067 --> 01:14:26.679
He just jacked up
the price of the poster

1455
01:14:26.723 --> 01:14:28.333
and then offered to sign them.

1456
01:14:28.376 --> 01:14:30.074
I'm trying to free
Pepe the Frog.

1457
01:14:30.117 --> 01:14:31.554
And I'm either
going to succeed

1458
01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:33.991
or I'll be destroyed
in the process, but that's okay.

1459
01:14:35.514 --> 01:14:38.474
I actually don't know
many people on here.

1460
01:14:38.517 --> 01:14:39.953
- Is that Trump, too?
- Yeah.

1461
01:14:39.997 --> 01:14:41.259
-There's are two Trumps.
-Sounds like having two Trumps

1462
01:14:41.302 --> 01:14:43.348
in the same poster,
is that legal?

1463
01:14:45.393 --> 01:14:47.308
Well, that's Billie Joe
Armstrong from Green Day.

1464
01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:50.834
And there's Marsha
from The Brady Bunch.

1465
01:14:50.877 --> 01:14:52.139
-Billy Idol.

1466
01:14:52.183 --> 01:14:55.491
-Billy Idol.
-And there's Courtney Love.

1467
01:15:00.365 --> 01:15:02.236
A lot of times,
I'm cutting people's hair

1468
01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.543
for court
when they're in trouble so...

1469
01:15:04.587 --> 01:15:06.763
Yeah, I'm not into...
I'm not in any trouble at all.

1470
01:15:06.806 --> 01:15:09.896
Just, uh, weird situation.

1471
01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:12.725
Yeah, I've got this
kinda, like, a notorious,

1472
01:15:12.769 --> 01:15:14.988
uh, character named
Pepe the Frog.

1473
01:15:15.032 --> 01:15:16.773
-Have you ever heard of him?
- Yeah, I actually have.

1474
01:15:16.816 --> 01:15:19.253
-My kids have, too. Yeah.
-Oh, yeah?

1475
01:15:19.297 --> 01:15:22.692
- This guy, Pepe?
-Yeah, that guy right there.

1476
01:15:22.735 --> 01:15:25.433
So the guy, Matt,
do you know him?

1477
01:15:25.477 --> 01:15:26.565
That's me.

1478
01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:28.045
That who you got to go
to court with?

1479
01:15:28.088 --> 01:15:29.525
Oh, no, that's me. I am Matt.

1480
01:15:29.568 --> 01:15:30.830
- Oh, you're Matt.
-Yeah.

1481
01:15:31.918 --> 01:15:33.006
Oh.

1482
01:15:35.052 --> 01:15:38.272
I don't know who this guy is doing, this Furie fella.

1483
01:15:38.316 --> 01:15:40.144
But I agreed to be deposed...

1484
01:15:41.188 --> 01:15:43.364
for the Pepe the Frog deal.

1485
01:15:43.408 --> 01:15:44.931
Sir, would you raise
your right hand to be sworn?

1486
01:15:44.975 --> 01:15:46.019
Do you solemnly state

1487
01:15:46.063 --> 01:15:47.107
the testimony
you're about to give

1488
01:15:47.151 --> 01:15:48.282
will be the truth,
the whole truth

1489
01:15:48.326 --> 01:15:49.762
-and nothing but the truth?
-I do.

1490
01:15:53.766 --> 01:15:56.508
I don't like the frog.
I don't like this whole thing.

1491
01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:58.118
But I got to stand up
for the First Amendment.

1492
01:15:59.946 --> 01:16:01.905
Let's say the frog is triggering
for me now.

1493
01:16:03.863 --> 01:16:05.343
I hate Pepe.

1494
01:16:05.386 --> 01:16:07.693
Video tape deposition of Matt Furie

1495
01:16:07.737 --> 01:16:10.130
in the matter
of Matt Furie vs. InfoWars,

1496
01:16:10.174 --> 01:16:12.655
and Free Speech, LLC.

1497
01:16:13.786 --> 01:16:16.136
So from 2001 to 2007,

1498
01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:20.140
you had sort of this carefree
part-time, knucklehead life.

1499
01:16:21.489 --> 01:16:22.795
I still have that.

1500
01:16:22.839 --> 01:16:25.276
Excellent.

1501
01:16:25.319 --> 01:16:27.321
And what did you do to prepare
for today's deposition?

1502
01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:30.411
Really nothing.

1503
01:16:30.455 --> 01:16:33.850
So how did you pick
the name Pepe the Frog?

1504
01:16:33.893 --> 01:16:36.417
It sounded like, um, "peepee."

1505
01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:39.203
To go peepee.

1506
01:16:39.246 --> 01:16:40.770
So it is
a cartoon frog, right?

1507
01:16:40.813 --> 01:16:41.901
Yes, it's a cartoon frog.

1508
01:16:41.945 --> 01:16:44.512
It has round lips, right?

1509
01:16:45.513 --> 01:16:47.124
I wouldn't call that round lips.

1510
01:16:47.167 --> 01:16:49.387
- Okay. Uh...
-More tubular.

1511
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:50.954
Tubular lips.

1512
01:16:50.997 --> 01:16:53.783
I thought I had some kind of like Zen-like grip.

1513
01:16:53.826 --> 01:16:55.915
He kinda did the good cop,
bad cop thing on me.

1514
01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:59.005
He was like, "So you like
Beavis and Butthead"?

1515
01:16:59.049 --> 01:17:00.180
Do you watch
Ren and Stimpy?

1516
01:17:00.224 --> 01:17:01.399
Yes.

1517
01:17:01.442 --> 01:17:03.531
But then,
he was all kind of like...

1518
01:17:03.575 --> 01:17:04.707
"Let's get 'em."

1519
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:07.448
Forty-nine.
This is a fun one.

1520
01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:14.194
Hold that up
and tell us what's 49?

1521
01:17:14.238 --> 01:17:17.676
Um, yeah, it's an allegory
on the direction nature's going

1522
01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.809
from my perspective.

1523
01:17:19.852 --> 01:17:21.549
Uh, excuse me.
The second to last page.

1524
01:17:21.593 --> 01:17:22.8121528
01:10:45.937 --> 01:101525
01:17:22.855 --> 01:17:25.423
I worked out this morning.

1526
01:17:25.466 --> 01:17:27.381
It's just coincidental
that they look alike?

1527
01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:28.861
Absolutely.

1528
01:17:28.905 --> 01:17:32.952
An original character
that's based on a hot dog man.

1529
01:17:32.996 --> 01:17:35.172
Part man, part hot dog.

1530
01:17:35.215 --> 01:17:36.782
It's clear what all this is.

1531
01:17:36.826 --> 01:17:38.566
So people can say Jones is using
a white supremacist symbol

1532
01:17:38.610 --> 01:17:39.959
when it's not.

1533
01:17:40.003 --> 01:17:41.178
It's a way of saying
I'm a white supremacist.

1534
01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:44.355
It's a way of defaming me...

1535
01:17:44.398 --> 01:17:46.618
and acting like I stole
something all at the same time.

1536
01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:48.272
It's just... god! Evil!

1537
01:17:49.708 --> 01:17:51.754
That's just evil!

1538
01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:52.842
Is that Big Bird?

1539
01:17:52.885 --> 01:17:54.408
Yes.

1540
01:17:54.452 --> 01:17:55.540
Thirty-one
is not Grimace?

1541
01:17:55.583 --> 01:17:57.020
No.

1542
01:17:57.063 --> 01:17:59.718
So those aren't
derivations of the Hamburglar?

1543
01:17:59.762 --> 01:18:01.677
-Oh, these guys?
- Yes.

1544
01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.462
-Do you mean Mayor McCheese?

1545
01:18:04.505 --> 01:18:06.682
And you got no license
to put that up.

1546
01:18:06.725 --> 01:18:08.901
-When I was in sixth grade,

1547
01:18:08.945 --> 01:18:11.817
I did not attain the license
to draw this stuff.

1548
01:18:13.776 --> 01:18:15.212
You know, I went to the bathroom
at one point

1549
01:18:15.255 --> 01:18:18.258
and he's taking a piss, too,
and he's like, uh...

1550
01:18:18.302 --> 01:18:20.696
"So I guess this is where
all the dicks hang out."

1551
01:18:20.739 --> 01:18:22.915
And I was like,
"Ha ha, that's funny.

1552
01:18:22.959 --> 01:18:24.874
And also awkward
that I got my dick in my hand

1553
01:18:24.917 --> 01:18:26.571
and we're talking
right now and..."

1554
01:18:26.614 --> 01:18:27.877
And then, shortly after that,

1555
01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.226
he's just
fucking screaming at me.

1556
01:18:29.269 --> 01:18:31.794
We're suing, uh, Alex Jones...

1557
01:18:32.664 --> 01:18:33.883
because he...

1558
01:18:33.926 --> 01:18:35.014
That's not the question
I asked you.

1559
01:18:35.058 --> 01:18:36.233
Oh.

1560
01:18:36.276 --> 01:18:37.538
Answer the question
I asked you.

1561
01:18:37.582 --> 01:18:39.236
It... It...

1562
01:18:39.279 --> 01:18:42.587
twisted my noodles for a while
and I, like...

1563
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:45.285
You know when you, like,
say something in passing

1564
01:18:45.329 --> 01:18:47.200
to somebody else
and it's like...

1565
01:18:47.244 --> 01:18:48.854
you wish you would've said
something else.

1566
01:18:48.898 --> 01:18:52.336
This was like four hours of concentrated...

1567
01:18:52.379 --> 01:18:55.382
me wishing I would have said
something else.

1568
01:18:55.426 --> 01:18:57.254
It's not
a comfortable situation.

1569
01:18:57.297 --> 01:19:00.736
Dude, it sucked. It was hard.

1570
01:19:00.779 --> 01:19:02.999
From my point of view,
this is a direct copy.

1571
01:19:04.348 --> 01:19:06.306
So all of your
references before

1572
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:07.568
are just references.

1573
01:19:07.612 --> 01:19:09.179
But this one is what,
traced, you mean?

1574
01:19:09.222 --> 01:19:10.789
Yeah.

1575
01:19:10.833 --> 01:19:13.749
Why do you suppose Pepe
looks happy in that picture?

1576
01:19:13.792 --> 01:19:15.098
Pepe's kinda like a mirror.

1577
01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:18.754
So the way that users online
would use Pepe

1578
01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:20.364
is a reflection of...

1579
01:19:21.234 --> 01:19:22.670
themselves, to an extent.

1580
01:19:22.714 --> 01:19:26.239
That's my...
interpretation of it.

1581
01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:29.068
No further questions.

1582
01:19:29.112 --> 01:19:30.243
I have nothing else here either.

1583
01:19:30.287 --> 01:19:31.897
Thank you for your time.

1584
01:19:31.941 --> 01:19:33.551
This marks the end of the video
tape deposition of Alex Jones.

1585
01:19:33.594 --> 01:19:34.291
This marks the end of the video
tape deposition of Alex Jones.

1586
01:19:34.334 --> 01:19:35.901
Good luck.

1587
01:19:35.945 --> 01:19:38.338
We're going off record
and the time is 13:00 even.

1588
01:19:42.516 --> 01:19:43.561
Let's try to find
a little round...

1589
01:19:43.604 --> 01:19:45.868
- Oh!
-Oh, there it is.

1590
01:19:45.911 --> 01:19:48.522
-There.
-So we need two dark green ones.

1591
01:19:48.566 --> 01:19:49.785
Okay.

1592
01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:52.831
It took me weeks
to detangle my mind

1593
01:19:52.875 --> 01:19:57.618
after all this legal stuff.

1594
01:19:57.662 --> 01:19:59.925
That's what I signed up for,
you know.

1595
01:19:59.969 --> 01:20:01.622
It's not going
to be easy, but...

1596
01:20:01.666 --> 01:20:03.929
but I'm willing to go
the distance with this shit.

1597
01:20:10.109 --> 01:20:12.329
♪ And he hops and hops

1598
01:20:12.372 --> 01:20:16.246
♪ Pepe, watch out
And he hops and hops ♪

1599
01:20:16.289 --> 01:20:17.769
♪ Pepe, do stop

1600
01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:19.945
- ♪ And he hops and hops

1601
01:20:19.989 --> 01:20:21.991
♪ You make me dizzy

1602
01:20:22.034 --> 01:20:23.557
♪ You make me dizzy

1603
01:20:23.601 --> 01:20:25.559
♪ I say, Pepe, come here

1604
01:20:25.603 --> 01:20:28.127
-Yeah.
- ♪ And he hops and hops

1605
01:20:28.171 --> 01:20:29.737
♪ Pepe, watch out

1606
01:20:36.614 --> 01:20:39.269
Everybody's
saying congratulations.

1607
01:20:39.312 --> 01:20:43.360
"A sparkle of good news
in these troubling times."

1608
01:20:49.366 --> 01:20:51.020
This was actually
going to trial.

1609
01:20:51.063 --> 01:20:52.238
And then Louis was just, like,

1610
01:20:52.282 --> 01:20:54.893
"Oh, surprisingly
they want to settle."

1611
01:20:54.937 --> 01:20:57.548
We were confident we were gonna prevail at trial.

1612
01:20:57.591 --> 01:20:59.419
And InfoWars gave up.

1613
01:21:00.943 --> 01:21:03.075
It just went live
on InfoWars.com.

1614
01:21:03.119 --> 01:21:05.512
InfoWars settles
Pepe the Frog lawsuit.

1615
01:21:05.556 --> 01:21:08.776
Pays tiny settlement
to creator Matt Furie.

1616
01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:10.039
This amount...

1617
01:21:10.082 --> 01:21:12.258
It's a bar tab
at a topless club, you know,

1618
01:21:12.302 --> 01:21:13.607
for one good night, so...

1619
01:21:13.651 --> 01:21:15.218
-So, what the heck.

1620
01:21:15.261 --> 01:21:17.873
This is more than I've ever made on theBoy's Club comic books.

1621
01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:20.397
So, it just, kind of...
To put it into context, like,

1622
01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.181
Alex Jones is like...

1623
01:21:22.225 --> 01:21:25.054
"Hey, we got away
with barely paying anything."

1624
01:21:25.097 --> 01:21:26.969
But it's all...
it's all relative.

1625
01:21:27.012 --> 01:21:29.101
This is a big deal to show
what these bullies are up to

1626
01:21:29.145 --> 01:21:30.537
and what happens
when you stand up to them.

1627
01:21:33.714 --> 01:21:35.542
At the end of the day,
he's just...

1628
01:21:35.586 --> 01:21:39.720
selling a bunch of bad ideas,
bad supplements,

1629
01:21:39.764 --> 01:21:41.809
in a bad attitude.

1630
01:21:41.853 --> 01:21:44.160
It's just a business.

1631
01:21:44.203 --> 01:21:46.075
Without you buying
the videos and the books

1632
01:21:46.118 --> 01:21:47.467
and the supplements,

1633
01:21:47.511 --> 01:21:50.209
we couldn't put on
one hell of a junkyard dog fight

1634
01:21:50.253 --> 01:21:51.297
against these bastards.

1635
01:21:53.125 --> 01:21:55.214
This case
against InfoWars

1636
01:21:55.258 --> 01:21:57.825
was the latest
in a string of successes.

1637
01:21:57.869 --> 01:21:59.740
We went after Richard Spencer.

1638
01:21:59.784 --> 01:22:01.786
Uh, we went after Baked Alaska.

1639
01:22:01.829 --> 01:22:05.790
We went after the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website.

1640
01:22:05.833 --> 01:22:09.054
We have successfully enforced
Matt's copyrights in Pepe

1641
01:22:09.098 --> 01:22:12.971
against somewhere between 75
and 100 different entities

1642
01:22:13.015 --> 01:22:16.496
in connection with images
or language of hate.

1643
01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:19.369
And this is beginning
to turn the narrative

1644
01:22:19.412 --> 01:22:20.936
of Pepe back around.

1645
01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:35.559
This guys are, kind of,
like, messing with reality.

1646
01:22:35.602 --> 01:22:39.389
Amplifying negativity
or normalizing negativity.

1647
01:22:39.432 --> 01:22:42.000
And I'm doing everything I can
in my power

1648
01:22:42.044 --> 01:22:44.394
to change the course
of this thing.

1649
01:22:44.437 --> 01:22:47.701
And I think removing Pepe
from the hate symbol list,

1650
01:22:47.745 --> 01:22:49.225
it would be a win for...

1651
01:22:50.487 --> 01:22:51.575
peace.

1652
01:22:59.583 --> 01:23:01.628
With all these legal steps
that I'm taking,

1653
01:23:01.672 --> 01:23:03.935
everything I've been doing
up until now,

1654
01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:06.982
my goal is to get it off
the hate symbol database.

1655
01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:08.461
To me, it's not a symbol.

1656
01:23:08.505 --> 01:23:09.854
It's a character, you know.

1657
01:23:09.897 --> 01:23:11.247
It's the character,

1658
01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:13.162
but he's adorned with different
symbols, you know.

1659
01:23:13.205 --> 01:23:15.686
And they're pretty
extreme stuff.

1660
01:23:15.729 --> 01:23:17.340
I mean, yeah, you know.

1661
01:23:17.383 --> 01:23:20.038
It's tough, right? Having it
on the hate symbols database,

1662
01:23:20.082 --> 01:23:21.561
we have found
to be really useful

1663
01:23:21.605 --> 01:23:23.650
for those who are trying
to understand

1664
01:23:23.694 --> 01:23:26.218
this barrage of symbols
that is being thrown at them

1665
01:23:26.262 --> 01:23:29.308
whether it's a frog, a meme,
or a hand gesture.

1666
01:23:29.352 --> 01:23:31.093
- Mm-hmm.
-It's complicated.

1667
01:23:31.136 --> 01:23:32.833
Well, yeah,
it is complicated

1668
01:23:32.877 --> 01:23:34.618
because I think
with Pepe on the list,

1669
01:23:34.661 --> 01:23:37.577
it's seen more as a win for,
you know,

1670
01:23:37.621 --> 01:23:39.318
the so called alt-right
or these others

1671
01:23:39.362 --> 01:23:41.538
because now
they have that symbol.

1672
01:23:41.581 --> 01:23:44.236
You know, this is going to be
a lifelong journey for me

1673
01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.934
'cause I'm going to be entangled
with this character forever.

1674
01:23:46.978 --> 01:23:49.198
But what would be the impact
of removing it?

1675
01:23:49.241 --> 01:23:51.243
Most of these people
are creating these images

1676
01:23:51.287 --> 01:23:53.593
and are going to keep turning
these things out.

1677
01:23:53.637 --> 01:23:56.031
Your bottomline request...

1678
01:23:56.074 --> 01:23:57.858
It's really not going
to solve the issue.

1679
01:23:57.902 --> 01:24:00.383
It's not about this cartoon
being on the hate symbols list.

1680
01:24:01.253 --> 01:24:02.254
And it sucks!

1681
01:24:05.344 --> 01:24:06.563
- All right, man.
- Thanks a lot.

1682
01:24:06.606 --> 01:24:07.868
-Yeah, thank you.
-Good luck.

1683
01:24:20.272 --> 01:24:21.839
I don't want the narrative

1684
01:24:21.882 --> 01:24:25.451
to be like I'm victimized here.

1685
01:24:25.495 --> 01:24:29.542
People have to deal with horror on a daily level.

1686
01:24:30.630 --> 01:24:32.502
Let's work together, you know.

1687
01:24:32.545 --> 01:24:34.678
Let's uh... let's uh...

1688
01:24:36.462 --> 01:24:39.030
figure this shit out,
'cause, uh...

1689
01:24:39.074 --> 01:24:41.206
it's not getting any better,
you know.

1690
01:24:43.295 --> 01:24:45.341
All of the accounts
of what happened to me

1691
01:24:45.384 --> 01:24:48.518
and my family over the years
are enormous in scale

1692
01:24:48.561 --> 01:24:51.129
and historically rooted
in a legacy of white supremacy.

1693
01:24:51.173 --> 01:24:54.219
♪ This little light of mine

1694
01:24:54.263 --> 01:24:56.395
♪ I'm gonna let it shine

1695
01:24:56.439 --> 01:24:57.614
Why?
Why are you being provocative?

1696
01:24:57.657 --> 01:24:59.790
I like trolling people.
It's fun.

1697
01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:00.878
You do it for fun.

1698
01:25:00.921 --> 01:25:02.140
Yeah, it's fun.

1699
01:25:02.184 --> 01:25:04.186
The aesthetics and ideals

1700
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:06.536
that extremists
are promoting online

1701
01:25:06.579 --> 01:25:08.190
with their use of Pepe the Frog

1702
01:25:08.233 --> 01:25:10.279
are now bleeding completely

1703
01:25:10.322 --> 01:25:13.412
into what you would otherwise
describe as regular people.

1704
01:25:13.456 --> 01:25:14.544
Yeah,
go ahead and video me now.

1705
01:25:14.587 --> 01:25:16.589
I'm videoing you too,
motherfucker.

1706
01:25:16.633 --> 01:25:18.243
You know what's coming
to you people, right?

1707
01:25:18.287 --> 01:25:19.853
You know Trump
is just the beginning.

1708
01:25:21.507 --> 01:25:23.770
You bearded monkeys
have no place in America.

1709
01:25:25.946 --> 01:25:27.644
The ideology is premised

1710
01:25:27.687 --> 01:25:30.516
on justifying violence
towards vulnerable people.

1711
01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.390
USA! USA!

1712
01:25:34.433 --> 01:25:36.566
And when that seeps
into the beliefs

1713
01:25:36.609 --> 01:25:38.176
of regular Americans,

1714
01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:41.005
you're heading
for some place very bad.

1715
01:25:50.928 --> 01:25:52.451
You can't put the genie
back in the bottle,

1716
01:25:52.495 --> 01:25:54.453
but you can send it
somewhere else.

1717
01:25:56.281 --> 01:25:59.893
To actually change the narrative
it would be necessary

1718
01:25:59.937 --> 01:26:03.070
to take the frog, to take Pepe,

1719
01:26:03.114 --> 01:26:05.812
and do something very different
with him.

1720
01:26:07.379 --> 01:26:09.033
Something that could develop...

1721
01:26:09.947 --> 01:26:11.078
a meme of its own.

1722
01:26:27.443 --> 01:26:30.750
Suddenly, out of nowhere, Pepe is being used in Hong Kong

1723
01:26:30.794 --> 01:26:34.885
as a symbol of freedom,
democracy, and youth protest.

1724
01:26:34.928 --> 01:26:36.495
I was surprised
as much as anyone.

1725
01:26:42.066 --> 01:26:44.199
This is
the newer version of him.

1726
01:26:44.242 --> 01:26:45.461
He is wearing a hard hat

1727
01:26:45.504 --> 01:26:48.377
and he's wearing
the outfit of the protesters.

1728
01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:50.944
It was like a way
to resist authoritarianism.

1729
01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:01.041
Oh, he was crying
from the tear gas.

1730
01:27:01.085 --> 01:27:03.522
Pepe is now
being spray painted on walls

1731
01:27:03.566 --> 01:27:05.872
as a symbol of hope.

1732
01:27:08.092 --> 01:27:10.747
Like when does that
actually happened in history?

1733
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:12.314
You see it in movies
all the time.

1734
01:27:12.357 --> 01:27:15.142
Like, "This is the symbol
we're all gonna rally behind."

1735
01:27:15.186 --> 01:27:17.014
Yeah, this never happens
in reality,

1736
01:27:17.057 --> 01:27:19.277
except now it happened to Pepe.

1737
01:27:22.889 --> 01:27:24.935
Pepe beams
in everyone's brain

1738
01:27:24.978 --> 01:27:27.938
this idea of, like,
the every man.

1739
01:27:27.981 --> 01:27:30.549
As you grow up,
you realize that, i1738

01:27:30.593 --> 01:27:32.116
you1739
01:19:35.945 --> 01:1741
01:27:32.159 --> 01:27:35.380
and you can use a small lever

1742
01:27:35.424 --> 01:27:38.122
to actually move
a great amount of weight.

1743
01:27:40.907 --> 01:27:44.171
That's the power
that Pepe has, right? Like...

1744
01:27:44.215 --> 01:27:47.610
"Oh, what's more worthless
than cartoons?"

1745
01:27:47.653 --> 01:27:50.134
But like, "What's more powerful
than Mickey Mouse?"

1746
01:27:50.177 --> 01:27:51.657
Right? Like...

1747
01:27:51.701 --> 01:27:53.616
One of the most powerful things
you can do

1748
01:27:53.659 --> 01:27:55.270
is create an iconic cartoon.

1749
01:28:25.561 --> 01:28:27.476
In a lot
of traditional societies,

1750
01:28:27.519 --> 01:28:30.130
it was very standard
to look for omens.

1751
01:28:31.784 --> 01:28:35.222
Signs, strange portents, things that were not expected

1752
01:28:35.266 --> 01:28:36.702
that suddenly came
out of the blue.

1753
01:28:37.964 --> 01:28:39.314
Because that was a warning

1754
01:28:39.357 --> 01:28:40.880
something was shifting
in society,

1755
01:28:40.924 --> 01:28:42.099
something had gone wrong,

1756
01:28:42.142 --> 01:28:43.709
or there was something building

1757
01:28:43.753 --> 01:28:45.842
that you need to know about
before it arrived.

1758
01:28:47.409 --> 01:28:48.714
Pepe the frog is an omen.

1759
01:28:49.846 --> 01:28:51.195
We need to listen

1760
01:28:51.238 --> 01:28:53.632
because it's not going
to go away...

1761
01:28:53.676 --> 01:28:55.765
until we hear the message
that it has to say.

1762
01:29:03.555 --> 01:29:05.731
Nowadays,
I've just been thinking

1763
01:29:05.775 --> 01:29:08.908
about this concept of a spiral.

1764
01:29:08.952 --> 01:29:12.651
Life unfolding in this kind
of spirally nature.

1765
01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:17.743
So, I've been drawing
in more kind of circular ways.

1766
01:29:19.832 --> 01:29:22.444
I think that there is kind of
a collective consciousness

1767
01:29:22.487 --> 01:29:25.490
of darkness and light.

1768
01:29:25.534 --> 01:29:28.711
And the only thing
that seems true to me

1769
01:29:28.754 --> 01:29:30.800
is that everything
is going to change.

1770
01:29:30.843 --> 01:29:34.586
Like, Trump is not going
to always be the president.

1771
01:29:34.630 --> 01:29:37.807
You know, Planet Earth isn't
always gonna have people on it.

You know, who knows?

1773
01:29:40.418 --> 01:29:41.941
The positive notion
of Pepe

1774
01:29:41.985 --> 01:29:44.509
is the possibility
that you can change again.

1775

Hard core happy place.

You got to go hardcore happy.

But now,
I like drawing him again.

We went after the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:34.390
[crowd chanting]
USA! USA!

1870
01:25:34.433 --> 01:25:36.566
[Adam] And when that seeps
into the beliefs

1871
01:25:36.609 --> 01:25:38.176
of regular Americans,

1872
01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:41.005
you're heading
for some place very bad.

1873
01:25:41.048 --> 01:25:43.050
[crowd jeering]

1874
01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:49.361
[ominous music]

1875
01:25:50.928 --> 01:25:52.451
You can't put the genie
back in the bottle,

1876
01:25:52.495 --> 01:25:54.453
but you can send it
somewhere else.

1877
01:25:56.281 --> 01:25:59.893
To actually change the narrative
it would be necessary

1878
01:25:59.937 --> 01:26:03.070
to take the frog, to take Pepe,

1879
01:26:03.114 --> 01:26:05.812
and do something very different
with him.

1880
01:26:07.379 --> 01:26:09.033
Something that could develop...

1881
01:26:09.947 --> 01:26:11.078
a meme of its own.

1882
01:26:12.297 --> 01:26:14.604
[somber music]

1883
01:26:17.041 --> 01:26:19.217
[protesters chanting in Chinese]

1884
01:26:27.443 --> 01:26:30.750
[Dale]Suddenly, out of nowhere, Pepe is being used in Hong Kong

1885
01:26:30.794 --> 01:26:34.885
as a symbol of freedom,
democracy, and youth protest.

1886
01:26:34.928 --> 01:26:36.495
I was surprised
as much as anyone.

1887
01:26:36.539 --> 01:26:39.237
-[protesters chanting]
-[pops]

1888
01:26:42.066 --> 01:26:44.199
[Dale] This is
the newer version of him.

1889
01:26:44.242 --> 01:26:45.461
He is wearing a hard hat

1890
01:26:45.504 --> 01:26:48.377
and he's wearing
the outfit of the protesters.

1891
01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:50.944
[Dale] It was like a way
to resist authoritarianism.

1892
01:26:54.426 --> 01:26:55.558
[explosion]

1893
01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:01.041
[Dale] Oh, he was crying
from the tear gas.

1894
01:27:01.085 --> 01:27:03.522
[Matt] Pepe is now
being spray painted on walls

1895
01:27:03.566 --> 01:27:05.872
as a symbol of hope.

1896
01:27:08.092 --> 01:27:10.747
[Dale] Like when does that
actually happened in history?

1897
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:12.314
You see it in movies
all the time.

1898
01:27:12.357 --> 01:27:15.142
Like, "This is the symbol
we're all gonna rally behind."

1899
01:27:15.186 --> 01:27:17.014
Yeah, this never happens
in reality,

1900
01:27:17.057 --> 01:27:19.277
except now it happened to Pepe.

1901
01:27:19.321 --> 01:27:20.583
[chuckles]

1902
01:27:22.889 --> 01:27:24.935
[Dale] Pepe beams
in everyone's brain

1903
01:27:24.978 --> 01:27:27.938
this idea of, like,
the every man.

1904
01:27:27.981 --> 01:27:30.549
As you grow up,
you realize that, in fact,

1905
01:27:30.593 --> 01:27:32.116
you can affect the world,

1906
01:27:32.159 --> 01:27:35.380
and you can use a small lever

1907
01:27:35.424 --> 01:27:38.122
to actually move
a great amount of weight.

1908
01:27:38.165 --> 01:27:40.864
[crowd singing]

1909
01:27:40.907 --> 01:27:44.171
That's the power
that Pepe has, right? Like...

1910
01:27:44.215 --> 01:27:47.610
"Oh, what's more worthless
than cartoons?"

1911
01:27:47.653 --> 01:27:50.134
But like, "What's more powerful
than Mickey Mouse?"

1912
01:27:50.177 --> 01:27:51.657
[laughing]
Right? Like...

1913
01:27:51.701 --> 01:27:53.616
One of the most powerful things
you can do

1914
01:27:53.659 --> 01:27:55.270
is create an iconic cartoon.

1915
01:27:57.794 --> 01:28:00.057
[in Chinese]

1916
01:28:25.561 --> 01:28:27.476
In a lot
of traditional societies,

1917
01:28:27.519 --> 01:28:30.130
it was very standard
to look for omens.

1918
01:28:30.174 --> 01:28:31.741
[bubbling]

1919
01:28:31.784 --> 01:28:35.222
[Greer]Signs, strange portents, things that were not expected

1920
01:28:35.266 --> 01:28:36.702
that suddenly came
out of the blue.

1921
01:28:37.964 --> 01:28:39.314
Because that was a warning

1922
01:28:39.357 --> 01:28:40.880
something was shifting
in society,

1923
01:28:40.924 --> 01:28:42.099
something had gone wrong,

1924
01:28:42.142 --> 01:28:43.709
or there was something building

1925
01:28:43.753 --> 01:28:45.842
that you need to know about
before it arrived.

1926
01:28:47.409 --> 01:28:48.714
Pepe the frog is an omen.

1927
01:28:48.758 --> 01:28:49.802
[thunder crashes]

1928
01:28:49.846 --> 01:28:51.195
[Greer] We need to listen

1929
01:28:51.238 --> 01:28:53.632
because it's not going
to go away...

1930
01:28:53.676 --> 01:28:55.765
until we hear the message
that it has to say.

1931
01:28:55.808 --> 01:28:57.810
[ominous music]

1932
01:29:03.555 --> 01:29:05.731
[Matt] Nowadays,
I've just been thinking

1933
01:29:05.775 --> 01:29:08.908
about this concept of a spiral.

1934
01:29:08.952 --> 01:29:12.651
Life unfolding in this kind
of spirally nature.

1935
01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:17.743
So, I've been drawing
in more kind of circular ways.

1936
01:29:19.832 --> 01:29:22.444
I think that there is kind of
a collective consciousness

1937
01:29:22.487 --> 01:29:25.490
of darkness and light.

1938
01:29:25.534 --> 01:29:28.711
And the only thing
that seems true to me

1939
01:29:28.754 --> 01:29:30.800
is that everything
is going to change.

1940
01:29:30.843 --> 01:29:34.586
Like, Trump is not going
to always be the president.

1941
01:29:34.630 --> 01:29:37.807
You know, Planet Earth isn't
always gonna have people on it.

1942
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:39.069
You know, who knows?

1943
01:29:39.112 --> 01:29:40.375
[both laughing]

1944
01:29:40.418 --> 01:29:41.941
[Matt] The positive notion
of Pepe

1945
01:29:41.985 --> 01:29:44.509
is the possibility
that you can change again.

1946
01:29:48.121 --> 01:29:50.820
[burbling]

1947
01:29:52.604 --> 01:29:54.954
Hard core happy place.

1948
01:29:54.998 --> 01:29:56.869
You got to go hardcore happy.

1949
01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:05.225
[Matt]I still like drawing him.

1950
01:30:05.269 --> 01:30:06.575
I go through waves, like,

1951
01:30:06.618 --> 01:30:09.578
I think last time
I talked to you, Arthur,

1952
01:30:09.621 --> 01:30:10.796
I was sick of him.

1953
01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.276
But now,
I like drawing him again.

1954
01:30:13.364 --> 01:30:15.714
